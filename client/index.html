    <h1>Sophy,</h1>
    <p>
      Even though words can hardly express how grateful I am, I want to sincerely thank you for your powerful
      recommendation letter — especially on such short notice. While I didn’t receive the scholarship, your support
      truly meant the world to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your willingness to provide this reminds me why I consider you an incredible leader — not just in healthcare, but
      in any field. I’m truly thankful to have had the privilege of working with you and continue to strive toward the
      level of leadership you exemplify. I remain deeply appreciative of your encouragement and belief in me.
    </p>
